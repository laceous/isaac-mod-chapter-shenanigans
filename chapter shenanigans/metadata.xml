    <description>This mod requires REPENTOGON. Press the tilde key to open the new debug console and menu. There's a new Shenanigans option that will let you enable/disable chapters/modes/bosses/rooms/etc.

I wanted an easy way to see which chapters were unlocked, and decided to extend this to achievements that aren't related to specific item/trinket/card/rune unlocks.

Everything here is already in &quot;Stat and Achievement Shenanigans&quot;, just grouped together nicer.

There's also options to navigate between stages.</description>
